## üõ† Key Features  
- **Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handles missing values and applies **feature scaling** for consistency.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses **visualizations (Matplotlib & Seaborn)** to uncover insights from the dataset.  
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most relevant medical attributes contributing to diabetes risk.  
- **Model Training & Optimization**: Implements **Logistic Regression** and fine-tunes hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve**.  

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used  
- **Python** for model implementation  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  

## üìä Results & Impact  
The trained model provides **accurate predictions** of diabetes risk based on medical indicators, achieving **high precision and recall** scores. By integrating **AI-driven analytics in healthcare**, this project demonstrates how **machine learning** can aid in **early diagnosis and risk assessment**, leading to better medical outcomes.
